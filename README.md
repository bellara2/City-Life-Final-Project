# City-Life-Final-Project
For my final project for my statistics for social sciences course, I have decided to focus on city life in different cities in the United States of America. In this project, I have focused on the non hispanic white population with the poverty average in each city. The variables that I have chosen are poverty average, poverty average over 10, land locked, liveability, if the city has a basketball team, and if the city has a football team. Poverty Average is a quantitative variable, poverty average over 10 is qualitative, land locked is qualitative, liveability is quantitative, and if the city has a basketball team and if the city has a football team are both qualitative variables.

Data: 

The data that I have collected is the percentage of non hispanic white people and the poverty average rate in each city. I have obtained this information through the US Census & Individual City Websites. The question being asked is "Does the non hispanic white population have a statistical difference with Poverty Average?". Here are is the links to the sources that I have used.

Operationalization: 

The concept Non Hispanic White is operationalized by finding the perecentage that represents that group out of the whole population of the city. 

The concept Poverty is operationalized by finding the perecentage of the average poverty rate in each city. 

The concept of Land Locked is operationalized from 0 to 1 with 0 being no and 1 being yes. 

The concept Liveabilty is operationalized through the range of 0 to 100. 

The concept of Basketball is operationalized from 0 to 1 with 0 being no and 1 being yes. 

The concept of Football is operationalized from 0 to 1 with 0 being no and 1 being yes.
